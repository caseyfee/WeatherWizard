# WeatherWizard
Weather predictions from a handful of cities

## Description

The intention of this website is create a simple weather prediction application. To do this I needed to pull from third party APIs to collect data. 

This calendar was created using Web APIs, JavaScript, jquery, daysjs, Bootstrap, local storage, and interesting fonts. 

## Usage

A screenshot is included below of the site. The site images are saved locally and a screenshot is shown below.
