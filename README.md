# WeatherWizard
A weather prediction application for a simple and polished user

## Description

The intention of this website is create a simple weather prediction application. To do this I pulled from the OpenWeather API twice, once to get today's weather, and again to get the next 5 days. To create this application, I used a combination of bootstrap, dayjs, jquery, javascript, and getting a much better understanding of local storage so the user can re-click a previous search option.
